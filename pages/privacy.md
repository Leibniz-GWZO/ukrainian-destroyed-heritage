When you bring up our website, we collect the following data, which are technically essential for us to show you the website:

- The volume of transmitted data in bytes

The processing takes place in accordance with Art. 6 Section 1 lit. f DSGVO on the basis of our justified interest in improving the stability and functionality of our website. The data are neither passed on nor used for other purposes. However, we reserve the right to retrospectively review the server log files should there be concrete indications of illegal use.

Should some of the cookies we use also process personal data, this processing occurs in accordance with Art. 6 Sec. 1 lit f DSGVO for the preservation of our justified interests in the optimal functionality of the website as well in designing the web visit in a customer-friendly and effective way.

## 4. Contacting us

Personal data are gathered when you contact us (for example via email). These data are saved and utilised exclusively for the purpose of answering your concern or for establishing contact and the related technical administration. The legal foundation for the data processing is our justified interest in answering your concern in accordance with Art. 6 Sec. 1 lit. f DSGVO.  

Your data is deleted after your concern has been conclusively handled, which is the case when the circumstances make clear that the matter at hand has been conclusively clarified and provided that no legal retention duties oppose deletion.

## 5. Objection to marketing emails

Use of the contact data as published within the framework of imprint obligations by third parties in order to send advertising and informational material that is not expressly requested is herewith expressly ruled out. The operators of these pages expressly reserve the right to legal steps in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertisements, such as via spam emails.

## 6. Tools and Miscellaneous
Hosting Our host collects the following data transmitted by your browser in log files:

IP address, the address of the previously visited website (referrer request header), date and time of the request, time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time, content of the request, HTTP status code, amount of data transferred, website from which the request comes and information about the browser and operating system.

This is necessary to display our website and to ensure stability and security. This corresponds to our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.

There is no tracking and we have no direct access to this data.

We use the following hoster to provide our website:

GitHub Inc. 88 Colin P Kelly Jr St San Francisco, CA 94107 United States

This is the recipient of your personal data. This corresponds to our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR in not having to maintain a server on our premises ourselves. Server location is USA.

Further information on objection and removal options vis-à-vis GitHub can be found at: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages

You have the right to object to the processing. Whether the objection is successful must be determined as part of a balancing of interests.

The data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of the processing no longer applies.

The processing of the data specified in this section is not required by law or contract. The functionality of the website is not guaranteed without the processing.

GitHub has implemented compliance measures for international data transfers. These apply to all global activities where GitHub processes personal data of natural persons in the EU. These measures are based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). Further information can be found at: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service


In principle, an order processing contract must be concluded with the hoster. The Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision has made an exception for the hosting of purely static websites.In the event that the website is used for self-presentation, e.g. by associations or small companies, no personal data flows to the operator and no tracking takes place, there is no order processing. It goes on to say: ‘The fact that IP addresses, i.e. personal data, must inevitably be processed even when hosting static websites does not lead to the assumption of order processing.That would not be appropriate.Rather, the (short-term) storage of IP addresses is still part of the website hoster's telecommunication access brokerage pursuant to the TKG and primarily serves the hoster's security purposes.’(https://www.lda.bayern.de/media/veroeffentlichungen/FAQ_Hosting_keine_Auftragsverarbeitung.pdf) We assume that this exception applies to GitHub Pages.
